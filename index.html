<p>Lilacs have a deep rooted history originating in ancient Greek mythology. It was said that Pan, the god of forests and fields was hopelessly in love with a nymph named Syringa. One day he was pursuing her through a forest and, afraid of his advances, she turned herself into a lilac shrub to disguise herself. To Pan’s surprise, he could not find Syringa, but he did find the shrub. Because a lilac shrub consists of hollow reeds, he cut the reeds and created the first pan pipe. The scientific name for lilac is Syringa vulgaris, and the name is derived from the Greek word “syrinks” which means pipe. The name lilac comes from Spain and France. In Persian and Arabic language the word lilak is used to determine the lilac flower. As you can see, all those names are very similar.
However, it is also important to mention that in old Sanskrit language the word that was used for the lilac flower was nilah. This word had the meaning of dark blue color that is one of the colors typical for the lilac flower. It is believed that all words for the lilac flower come originally from the word nilah.</p>
